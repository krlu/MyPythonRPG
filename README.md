# MyPythonRPG
A python based repository for game development, using pygame

This is a python version of an RPG I made back in 2013 in Java.
The purposes of this project is to experiment with 2D graphics while building an interactive game environment from scratch. 

I appreciate any suggestions and/or contributions to this project, as this is a continuous project which sadly over the years I no longer have had the time work on as much as I would like
